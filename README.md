## Image Processing - Search a given shape from a larger image template composed of multiple shapes. The code can also give out the coordinates and orientation information of the matching shape found in the larger template.

* Search a given shape from a larger image template composed of multiple shapes.
* Give the coordinates and transformation and angle of rotation information of the matching shape found in the larger template.
* Locate a room in a floor plan image
* Search the closest matching shape in an floor plan image from a set of room images and give the angle of rotation needs to be rotated to match with the one in floor plan.
* The challenge here is that the two sets are of different scales - unless we figure out the scale is not easy to match magnitudes and the floor plan could be much more complex.
